# Why?
**Without allowing an outlet for freethinking and creativity we all would go a little mad.**

I wanted to build a platform where my thoughts could be critiqued, even after I am gone. Assuming GitHub doesn't go the way of GeoCities, that is.

This website does not utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN), or any type of tracking. If you're reading this I'll never know, and more importantly I won't collect any data about who you are. Though, I **may** add a comment system in the future.

# Tell Me What To Expect
I tend to go down topic rabbit holes. We'll break what you can expect down by areas and categories:
- Area
  - Professional
    - Category
      - What 'Agilility' means in business
      - _Still considering other categories_
  - Personal
    - Category
      - Entrepreneurship in plain English
      - Music, but not always played well
      - Short pieces of fiction
      - _Still cosidering other categories_
