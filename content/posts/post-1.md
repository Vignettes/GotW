```git
git commit -m "Gonna Make It"
```

Instead of a rant about why this site is important I'm going to lead by saying these words--and any words on this page--aren't important. If anything of importance or value comes out of this it will be because we had a change to exchange ideas and concepts. 

Speaking of which...

## Things I Need To Add
- [ ] Comment features or way to repost via Twitter 
- [ ] Content about current projects
- [ ] Add templates for deploying content
- [ ] Meme magic

This site contains no trackers. 
Come as you are, leave as you were.
